**Dataset** : [Oxford-102 flowers dataset](https://www.robots.ox.ac.uk/~vgg/data/flowers/102/). 
For our implementation, we used the images that can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1uORr7J-8jWaovhcH7IhOzFIb2liV2w7j?usp=sharing). 
For each image, we have text descriptions that can be accessed [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/18H5iIRidsH7FHuz0VBI3toSWQ8M4caIt?usp=sharing).

**Implementation Summary**:  
• Implemented DCGAN architecture for T2I using PyTorch and trained the model on   
• Implemented modules for
